### 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Two strings are close if you can convert one string into the other by performing a series of operations. The operations allowed are:

* Swap two characters in any string.
* Rearrange the characters of any string.

The two strings are close if and only if:

* The two strings have the same length.
* The two strings have the same set of characters with the same frequencies, though the characters can be in any order.
