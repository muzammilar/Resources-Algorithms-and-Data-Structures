### 735. Asteroid Collision

We are given an integer array `asteroids` representing asteroids in a row. For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive for right, negative for left). Asteroids move at the same speed and will collide if they meet while traveling in opposite directions.

You need to determine the state of the asteroids after all collisions have taken place. If two asteroids collide, the larger one will survive. If they are the same size, both will be destroyed.

You need to return an array of integers representing the remaining asteroids in the row after all collisions.
