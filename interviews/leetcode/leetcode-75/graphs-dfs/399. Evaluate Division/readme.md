### Problem Statement: 399. Evaluate Division

You are given an array of equations and an array of values, where:
- `equations[i] = [A, B]` represents an equation `A / B = values[i]`, where `A` and `B` are variables, and `values[i]` is the result of the division.
- You are also given an array of queries where each query is a division query of the form `[A, B]`. You need to evaluate the value of `A / B`.

Return the answers to the queries. If a variable has no valid path to the denominator, return `-1.0`.

##### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input:
equations = [["a", "b"], ["b", "c"]], values = [2.0, 3.0], queries = [["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"]]
Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
Explanation:
Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0, we can compute the following:
a / c = a / b * b / c = 2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0
b / a = 1 / (a / b) = 1 / 2.0 = 0.5
a / e = -1.0 since there is no path from a to e
a / a = 1.0 since a / a = 1
x / x = -1.0 since there is no path from x to x
```

##### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input:
equations = [["a", "b"], ["b", "c"], ["bc", "cd"]], values = [1.5, 2.5, 5.0], queries = [["a", "c"], ["c", "b"], ["bc", "cd"], ["cd", "bc"]]
Output: [3.75, 0.4, 5.0, 0.2]
```

##### Constraints:
- `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
- `equations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= values.length == equations.length`
- `0 <= values[i] <= 20`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `A, B, C` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

#### Approach

This problem can be solved using **Graph Search** (specifically **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**). The key idea is to represent the equations as a graph where each variable is a node, and each equation represents a directed edge with a weight equal to the division value.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We will create an undirected graph where each node (a variable) has edges to its neighbors (other variables) weighted by the division result.
   - For each equation `A / B = value`, we add an edge from `A` to `B` with weight `value` and an edge from `B` to `A` with weight `1 / value` (since division is bidirectional).

2. **DFS or BFS for Query Evaluation**:
   - For each query `A / B`, we need to search for a path from `A` to `B`. If a path exists, we compute the product of the edge weights along the path to get the result.
   - If no path exists, the answer is `-1.0`.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Since the graph is undirected, DFS or BFS will naturally handle cycles, and we'll avoid revisiting nodes.

#### Time Complexity

- **O(E + Q)** where `E` is the number of edges (equations) and `Q` is the number of queries. Each query involves a DFS traversal of the graph.

#### Space Complexity

- **O(V + E)** where `V` is the number of nodes (variables) and `E` is the number of edges (equations).
