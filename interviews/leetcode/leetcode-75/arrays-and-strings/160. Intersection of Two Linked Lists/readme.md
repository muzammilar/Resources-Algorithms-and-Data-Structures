### 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

We are given two singly linked lists, `headA` and `headB`, and we need to find the node where the two lists intersect (i.e., the first node they have in common).
The intersection is defined as a node that is shared between the two lists, with the nodes having the same reference in memory.
