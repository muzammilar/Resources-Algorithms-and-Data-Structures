### 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of **LCA** on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
