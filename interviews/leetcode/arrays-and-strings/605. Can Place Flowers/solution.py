# ChatGPT Solution:

# Approach:
# Traverse the flowerbed array.
# Check if the current position is empty (0) and its neighbors (left and right) are also empty (or out of bounds).
# If it satisfies the conditions, plant a flower (set to 1) and reduce the required count n.
# If n reaches 0, return true.
# If traversal ends and n > 0, return false.

class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: list[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0  # To count the number of flowers that can be planted
        length = len(flowerbed)

        for i in range(length):
            # Check if the current position is empty and the adjacent positions are also empty
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and (i == length - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
                # Plant a flower here
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                count += 1
                if count >= n:  # Stop early if we already placed enough flowers
                    return True

        return count >= n  # Final check if we placed enough flowers
