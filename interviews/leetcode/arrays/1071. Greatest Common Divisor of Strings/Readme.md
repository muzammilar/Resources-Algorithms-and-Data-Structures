### 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, you need to determine the longest string `X` that can be repeated multiple times to form both `str1` and `str2`.

In other words, you need to find the greatest common divisor of the two strings, where the GCD is defined as the largest possible string that can exactly divide both string
