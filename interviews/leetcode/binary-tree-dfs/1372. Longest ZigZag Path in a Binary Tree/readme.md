### 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

You are given the root of a binary tree. A **ZigZag path** is a path that starts at any node in the tree and then alternates between left and right child nodes. Specifically, the first move must be either to the left or to the right. After that, each subsequent move must alternate directions (i.e., if the previous move was to the left, the next move must be to the right, and vice versa).

Return the length of the longest **ZigZag path** in the tree.
